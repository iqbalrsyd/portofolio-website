# DevOps Pipeline & Observability

---

Enterprise-grade CI/CD infrastructure with comprehensive monitoring stack using Jenkins, Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki for microservices environments.

<br/>

## 📊 Overview

Built production-ready DevOps infrastructure focused on automation and observability. The system handles automated build, test, and deployment workflows while providing real-time visibility into service health and performance.

**Key Components:**
- Jenkins pipelines for automated deployments
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization dashboards
- Loki for centralized log aggregation

<br/>

## 🎯 Achievements

**CI/CD Automation:**
